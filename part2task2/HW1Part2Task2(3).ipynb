And it\\'s a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don\\'t know what he\\'s talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we\\'ve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\"\\n\"159', 'LUKE', 'Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\"\\n\"160', 'THREEPIO', 'I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he\\'s talking about?\"\\n\"161', 'LUKE', 'Well, I don\\'t know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.

I\\'ll be right back.\"\\n\"172', 'THREEPIO', 'Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\"\\n\"173', 'THREEPIO', 'No, I don\\'t think he likes you at all.\"\\n\"174', 'THREEPIO', 'No, I don\\'t like you either.\"\\n\"175', 'LUKE', 'You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\"\\n\"176', 'OWEN', 'What makes you think that?\"\\n\"177', 'LUKE', 'Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\\n\"178', 'LUKE', 'I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he\\'s talking about?  Well, I wonder if he\\'s related to Ben.\"\\n\"179', 'OWEN', 'That old man\\'s just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.

In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\"\\n\"184', 'LUKE', 'Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.

These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can\\'t understand their logic at times. \"\\n\"202', 'LUKE', 'How could I be so stupid?  He\\'s nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\"\\n\"203', 'THREEPIO', 'Pardon me, sir, but couldn\\'t we go after him?\"\\n\"204', 'LUKE', 'It\\'s too dangerous with all the Sand People around.

Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\"\\n\"210', 'OWEN', 'Have you seen Luke this morning?\"\\n\"211', 'AUNT BERU', 'He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\"\\n\"212', 'OWEN', 'Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\"\\n\"213', 'AUNT BERU', 'I think so.\"\\n\"214', 'OWEN', 'Well, he\\'d better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there\\'ll be hell to pay!\"\\n\"215', 'LUKE', 'How\\'s that.\"\\n\"216', 'LUKE', 'Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don\\'t see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn\\'t going to take this very well.\"\\n\"217', 'THREEPIO', 'Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\"\\n\"218', 'LUKE', 'Sure.  He needs you.  He\\'d probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\"\\n\"219', 'THREEPIO', 'Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn\\'t removed his restraining bolt...\"\\n\"220', 'LUKE', 'Wait, there\\'s something dead ahead on the scanner.

You\\'re fortunate he doesn\\'t blast you into a million pieces right here.\"\\n\"223', 'LUKE', 'Well, come on. It\\'s getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\"\\n\"224', 'THREEPIO', 'If you don\\'t mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you\\'ve gotten him back to your workshop.\"\\n\"225', 'LUKE', 'No, he\\'s not going to try anything.\"\\n\"226', 'LUKE', 'What\\'s wrong with him now?\"\\n\"227', 'THREEPIO', 'Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\"\\n\"228', 'LUKE', 'Sand People!

Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\"\\n\"236', 'LUKE', 'Oh, this little droid!  I think he\\'s searching for his former master...  I\\'ve never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?

Now thats a name I haven\\'t heard in a long time... a long time.\"\\n\"238', 'LUKE', 'I think my uncle knew him.

Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\"\\n\"253', 'LUKE', 'You fought in the Clone Wars?\"\\n\"254', 'BEN', 'Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\"\\n\"255', 'LUKE', 'I wish I\\'d known him.\"\\n\"256', 'BEN', 'He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you\\'ve become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...\"\\n\"257', 'BEN', 'I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn\\'t allow it.

This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\"\\n\"262', 'BEN', 'An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\"\\n\"263', 'LUKE', 'How did my father die?\"\\n\"264', 'BEN', 'A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\"\\n\"265', 'LUKE', 'The Force?\"\\n\"266', 'BEN', 'Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.

It binds the galaxy together.\"\\n\"267', 'BEN', 'Now, let\\'s see if we can\\'t figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.\"\\n\"268', 'LUKE', 'I saw part of the message he was...\"\\n\"269', 'BEN', 'I seem to have found it.\"\\n\"270', 'LEIA', 'General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father\\'s request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I\\'m afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you\\'re my only hope.\"\\n\"271', 'BEN', 'You must learn the ways of the Force if you\\'re to come with me to Alderaan.\"\\n\"272', 'LUKE', 'Alderaan?

Vader, release him!\"\\n\"293', 'VADER', 'As you wish.\"\\n\"294', 'TARKIN', 'This bickering is pointless.

We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\"\\n\"295', 'LUKE', 'It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It\\'s just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\"\\n\"296', 'BEN', 'They didn\\'t.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.
